## Problem 1: https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
Determine if a given singly linked list is palindrome or not?

Do this in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity

 

Example 1:

Input: 1->23

Output: false
Example 2:

Input: 11->21->21->11

Output: true


## Problem 2: https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/

You are given a binary tree find if it is height-balanced or not. for this problem assume that height -balanced tree is defined as: 

a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

   given the following tree [31,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

   31





   / \





  9  20





    /  \





   15   7
Return true.
Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,20,20,30,30,null,null,40,40]:

      1





      / \





     20   20





    / \





   30  30





  / \





 40   40

Return false.
