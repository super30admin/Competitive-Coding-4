Problem#2:
-----------
This problem was asked at Amazon, Google
You are given a binary tree find if it is height-balanced or not. for this problem assume that height -balanced tree is defined as:
a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:
given the following tree [31,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
 31
/ \
9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.
Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,20,20,30,30,null,null,40,40]:

      1


      / \
     20   20
    / \

   30  30
  / \
 40   40

Return false.
